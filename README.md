# Master Python Programming from Scratch 🐍

This repository documents my learning journey through the **"Master Python Programming from Scratch"** course by **CodeWithHarry** Sir on Udemy.

I started this repository *before completing the course* to ensure consistency, discipline, and hands-on learning from day one. The focus is not just on watching lessons, but on writing real code, practicing concepts, and building a strong Python foundation.
